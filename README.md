# Social isolation and loneliness_CVD to depression
Code utilized in the paper "The Risk of social isolation and loneliness on progression from incident CVD to subsequent depression"

Multistate models were constructed to investigate the effects of loneliness and social isolation on the transitions from a healthy state to incident CVD, further to subsequent depression, and to death. Specifically, we established five transitions in the multistate model of pattern A (Figure 2), including: 1) baseline to incident CVD; 2) baseline to death; 3) incident CVD to subsequent depression; 4) incident CVD to death; and 5) subsequent depression to death.
